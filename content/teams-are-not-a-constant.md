excerpt: A very common mistake is to assume that once your team is delivering features then your work is done. Teams are never in finished or in a constant state but rather something living and ever-changing.

A very common mistake is to assume that once your team is delivering features then your work is done. Teams are never in finished or constant state but rather something living and ever-changing.

There are many events that can cause a change in the team dynamics, productivity or mood:

- New people joining the team
- People leaving the team or the company
- Changing priorities
- Real world events such as the Corona pandemic

Thankfully, there are also great frameworks to help you understand where your team currently is and how to help them move towards becoming healthy and productive team:

- [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development#Group_development)
- [Four stages of a team](https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/)

To set your team up for success itâ€™s important to be aware of the fact that team changes require changes in expectations as well.
Changes to a team whether it is about changing scope or team members should come with a change in expectations equal to the team change. This provides the much needed space to get back on track to becoming a productive team.

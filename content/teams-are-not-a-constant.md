excerpt: A very common mistake is to assume that once your team is delivering features then your work is done. Teams are never in finished or in a constant state but rather something living and ever-changing.

Dealing with team changes can be very frustrating. Sometimes, it leads to a lack of delivery, decreased team mood, or even people quitting. There are a few things to be especially aware of when your team is going through change. Being open-minded to these frameworks can make a difference.

A widespread mistake is to assume that your work is done once your team is delivering features. Teams are never in a finished or constant state but rather something living and ever-changing.
Many events can cause a change in the team dynamics, productivity or mood:

- New people joining the team
- People leaving the team or the company
- Changing priorities
- Real-world events such as the Corona pandemic

Thankfully, there are also great frameworks to help you understand where your team currently is and how to help them move towards becoming a healthy and productive team:

- [Tuckman's stages of group development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development#Group_development)
- [Four stages of a team](https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/)

To set up your team for success, you need to match the team changes with a change in expectations. Whether it is about changing the scope or team members, changes to a team should change expectations equal to the team change. This provides the much-needed space to get back on track to becoming a productive team.

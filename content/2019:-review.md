I normally do not publish my yearly reviews but I honestly quite like reading other people’s reviews. So I thought it was only fair to publish mine instead of only reading everyone else’s.

2019 has quite honestly been life-changing. It has been extremely hard but thinking back, I am quite happy with how it went.

## Stepping up in open-source
At the end of December 2018, I officially joined the Ember Core Learning Team but I did not get a feel for what that meant before 2019. 

I was honestly quite surprised that I would end up joining a core team considering I never really thought of myself as a very good developer. It turns out that I am a decent developer but I quickly learned that the most important skill of a core team member is not computer science skills. It is about showing up and sticking around. 

In projects like Ember.js that does not have a backing company specifically hiring people to work on it, the most valuable thing you can do is showing up consistently. Maybe you write a few lines of documentation once a week or maybe you help out with a code review - as long as you stick to it.

I always imagined that if I ever joined the core team I would end up contributing much more code than before, but I found that was not the best use of my open source time. Instead, I have spent most of my open source time in 2019 on being a mentor and helping people get into open source. 

My absolute favorite open-source moment of 2019 was when Anne-Greeth went from helping me out with the release post to [speaking at EmberFest](www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBJTqnwUutI). And even better, she is now going to be a speaker at EmberConf 2020. So awesome!

I am still going to show up in 2020 and I hope you will too.

## Changing Roles

2019 was also the year where I started transitioning from a developer role into a manager role. This has been a big relief for me. I thrive way more as an engineering manager than I did as a senior developer. To be honest, I was very close to burning out with development and I think the jump away from coding all day long has allowed me to breathe again. I still code and I still love to code, but for the sake of my mental well-being, I do not think I can stay in a full-time developer role anymore. I feel so privileged that I got the opportunity to grow into a new role.

## Moving to Germany

In November my wife, our dog and I moved from Copenhagen, Denmark to Frankfurt am Main, Germany. This was intensely scary and while the anxiety has not settled completely yet, I am slowly starting to settled here in Germany.

I never thought I would have moved abroad - especially not to a city I have never been in before. But we did it and I hope that we will have a good 2020 here.

## Speaking and Traveling

I was so privileged to get to speak at EmberConf in Portland in 2019. I had never been to the United States before and it was quite an experience.

While it was a dream come true to finally meet all the wonderful people in the community it made me think about traveling and the costs of being away for conferences. It was the first time I have ever traveled that far on a plane and I felt disgusting doing it. Besides being selfish, I  have no justifications to travel that far for a two-day conference.

I loved being there, but I am unsure if I will travel that far for a conference again by plane.

## 2020

My biggest wishes for 2020 are more stability, spending more time with my wife, and reading more books.

And if you want your 2020 to envolve open-source and Ember.js then please drop me a DM.
